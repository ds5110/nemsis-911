### Darby, Duggan, Jordan Project

## Story

The primary aim of this project is to replicate the analysis conducted by Peters et al. (2022) in their paper titled *"Differences in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Management and Outcomes across Urban, Suburban, and Rural Settings"*. The reference article investigates various differences in cardiac arrest management and outcomes by stratifying by geographic settings. To reproduce the analysis, we are using updated data from 2022 as compared to the original study, which used data from 2018. The NEMSIS Public Release Research Dataset can be found at the following link: https://nemsis.org/using-ems-data/request-research-data/

A significant challenge we've encountered is related to the data preparation conducted by Aaron Fihn, which doesn't include all the necessary columns required for our analysis. This prompted us to restructure the data to include the critical columns needed for replication. The project is also designed with reproducibility in mind, ensuring future students can utilize our work to carry the project further. While our results may differ due to the temporal gap and the intervening COVID-19 pandemic's impact on healthcare systems, we aim to carefully explain any observed deviations between the results of our analysis and that of Peters et al (2022).

The main revisions to this story involve detailing the revised analytic objectives based on data exploration and adaptation required to overcome unforeseen challenges. We will clearly identify and justify any changes based on stakeholder feedback and explain the reason behind them.

## Approach

To achieve the project goals, our approach involves the following:

1. **Data Re-preparation:** We are restructuring the data files to include the correct columns that Peters et al. originally utilized in their analysis. This reworking is currently in progress, and we expect to complete it within the next one or two weeks.
2. **Data Analysis:** Once the re-prepared dataset is ready, we will filter the data based on the same criteria as the original study and compute the relevant statistics. One of the main challenges we face is that we don't know exactly what codes they used, so we can comment that we will attempt to recreate and clearly label which codes we are using which will improve reproducibility.
3. **Comparison and Hypothesis Generation:** We will compare our findings to those presented by Peters et al., particularly exploring differences in outcomes, as our dataset is from a different year. We will offer hypotheses to explain deviations in results- these hypothesis may be somewhat speculative in nature given the scope of our work on this project.

Potential risks to the project include the availability of required data elements, technical issues during the restructuring process, and difficulties in matching the study methodology. To mitigate these risks, we are keeping comprehensive documentation of our work, which should help manage unexpected problems and assist future participants in extending this project.

This project will make a unique contribution by using recent data, allowing a comparison of trends over time in cardiac arrest management and outcomes. In addition, when our analysis is complete, we may be able to provide some small insights into how healthcare disruptions, like COVID-19, may have impacted out-of-hospital cardiac care.
