## Darby, Duggan, Jordan - Project

## Milestones and Timeline

1. **Data Re-preparation (11/11 - 11/22):**
   - Restructure the dataset to include all the necessary columns required to replicate Peters et al.'s analysis. 
   - Ensure that each data column is correctly labeled and validated to align with the original analysis framework.

2. **Data Analysis (11/22 - 11/29):**
   - Filter the dataset based on the same criteria used in the original study.
   - Run statistical analyses to replicate the original outcomes, paying special attention to outcome differences across urban, suburban, and rural settings. Also specifically noting outcomes related to the administration of Epinephrine.

3. **Comparison and Result Evaluation (11/29 - 12/4):**
   - Compare our results with those presented in Peters et al.'s 2018 study.
   - Evaluate any differences in results, formulating hypotheses on the potential reasons for deviations between our outcomes and Peter et al.

4. **Final Report and Documentation (12/5):**
   - Compile findings into a report with detailed documentation on data processing, analysis methods, and results.
   - Ensure all work is reproducible by others and provide comprehensive notes for future students who might continue the project.

## Measurable Outcomes

- **Completion of Data Re-preparation:** Restructured dataset validated against the original study's requirements.
- **Data Analysis Completion:** Execution of statistical analysis and generation of key metrics that replicate those in the reference article.
- **Comparison Report:** Document summarizing differences between 2018 and 2022 findings, with hypotheses addressing deviations.
- **Final Documentation:** Well-documented scripts, analysis findings, and an explanatory report.
